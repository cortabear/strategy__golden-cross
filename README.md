# Strategy : The Golden Cross
The Golden Cross Strategy Demo  
In this demo we will walk through the creation of the infamous '[Golden Cross Strategy](https://etfdb.com/etf-education/3-simple-moving-average-etf-trading-strategies/)' trading strategy using NinjaTrader 8.  

**pseudo-code**  
> IF the simple moving average (SMA) of the 'investment' in a 10 period timespan just moved up and crossed over the simple moving average (SMA) of the 20 period timespan THEN BUY the 'investment'. Set a stop loss at 10% loss and a profit target of 20%.  

> IF a profit target order is generated in addition to a stop loss order, they are submitted as OCO (one cancels other).

As with all C# files there are a series of declarations at the top of the file.

The class that has been created inherits from 'Strategy'. 'Strategy' comes from a 'NinjaTrader.Strategy.Strategy' DLL.

**Stadard Variables & Methods**  
Every strategy comes with a default set of variables and methods.

**Initialize()**  
Whenever this strategy is loaded

**OnBarUpdate()**  
Whenever ever the candle closes.

**Set Stop Loss Method**  
We will start by defining the stop loss and profit target. At the time of this writting we choose to execute these globablly rather than executing them on a per trade bases.
```C#  
// ...
else if (State == State.Configure)
{

    /*
    STOP LOSS  
    Setting the stop loss for positions globally.

    Syntax
    - SetStopLoss( CalculationMode mode, double value )
    - SetProfitTarget( CalculationMode mode, double value )
    */
    SetStopLoss( CalculationMode.Percent, .3 );
    SetProfitTarget( CalculationMode.Percent, .2 );

}
// ...
```
